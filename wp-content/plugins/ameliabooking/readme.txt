##IMPORTANT NEWS!

## In one of our newest versions, we introduced a new, remodelled and improved appointment booking form.

With this booking form, UX and UI are pushed to the next level. New appointment scheduling form is smoother, steps load faster and the conversion rate is higher.


## What makes new booking form the best on the market:

- **Modern design**

A new booking form is modern, looks attractive, and contains crucial booking-related information. The entire booking process consists of several intuitive and easy-to-navigate steps. We took a closer look at the behaviour of the users and improved the whole booking process for appointment and event booking. Each action your client needs during the booking process is disposable and a click away. The UI design of the new booking form skyrockets the UX improvement.

- **Category selection**

Navigation through a list of your services is easier compared to the old booking experience. During the appointment process, your clients can click through all service categories. All services are organized within dropdown menus, and grouped by categories. This type of preview gives them a detailed insight into all services you offer.

- **Smooth and animated step-to-step transition**

A step-to-step transition process is accelerated with modern loaders working from behind. Transitional animations appearing when moving from one step to another are modernizing the entire process, making the scheduling process more interesting.

- **Contact us option**

If your clients have any questions or concerns, they can contact you using clickable email that is positioned at a visible place. This feature is optional.

- **Sidebar with the selected booking-related details**

Display of the booking process in real-time is presented via sidebar. This is how finished and unfinished steps are differentiated. Before the definite scheduling confirmation, your clients can edit every process by clicking on the step back. This option helps them to navigate the booking process.

- **Larger booking calendar with available and unavailable time slots**

The booking calendar is larger, therefore each customer can easily see the difference between available and unavailable days.

- **A better summary of the finished booking**

The improved form offers easy tracking of all past bookings recapitulation out of the client dashboard.

- **Simple customization page**

You can effortlessly customize the form to extend where the look and feel match your brand needs. Designs you can achieve with new options are numerous. The form will appear to your users as more attractive.

- **Improved loading speed**

By adding more up-to-date technology and logic, we’ve managed to speed up the loading process. This is one of the crucial benefits. Your customer booking experience will become faster and smoother which will directly impact the number of finished bookings.

- **Improved conversion rate**

The intuitive, simple, informative, and fast-loading form will give your customers the joy of smooth and effortless usage. This will impact the customers’ retention rate increment.

## New Form vs Old Form

New booking form is faster to load, more insightful, more intuitive, easier to navigate, and comes with more customization options. Setting up the new booking form is easier, and the usage is straightforward. And what's most important, the new and improved Amelia Booking System is inviting and conversion-optimized.


***Note:** The old appointment booking form will be available until the total switch to the new form happens, which the users will be informed about in a timely manner.*
